![*Around here, however, we don't look backwards for very long. We keep moving forward, opening up new doors and doing new things, because we're curious...and curiosity keeps leading us down new paths*. -Walt Disney](http://i.imgur.com/FeW7HWn.jpg[/img])

Disney’s statement above succinctly reflects the approach driving many startups to make the next big thing.  Some succeed, some fail.  But they all “keep moving forward” in either case.  It is an industry where we are constantly learning, and for those who are in it, I believe that it keeps us young.

I have worked in startups for the last 6 years doing operations and business development.  The best part of it was working directly with customers and the product teams to help build software products that delighted those same customers.  It was satisfying and I enjoyed the process of helping to make something.

Yet, it is more empowering to be the maker.

To better understand and be in control of software product development, I studied the software makers and started learning more about product management.  Although I learned much by working directly with product managers, I took courses and read books on the subject.  It elucidated a lot of the concepts I learned through work.

To be really involved in it, getting into coding was the next logical step.  I dabbled in simple coding over the years, but nothing too deep.  It wasn’t until I took a deeper dive by going through sites like [Codeacademy](http://www.codeacademy.com) and [Udemy](http://www.udemy.com) and completing several of their challenging coding programs that it solidified my movement into this area.

Coding has been an exciting journey so far, allowing me to *make my own movement forward*, and I am having a great time.
